This is a project about Game Engine, developed by C++

  I love to play STG games, for example touhou series~ Thus I plan to develop a game engine so I can use this to make STG games 
by myself. And this engine can not only make STG, but also make other games, rpg, avg ... 

  Now this project is under developing ,so far I have realized these function points:
  
  + Memory
    * Auto Garbage Collection
    + Object Pool
      * Customed Object Pool
      * Object Pool Manager
    + String
      * Hash Compare
      * String Manager (Working...)
  + Task
    * Timer
    * Scheduler
  + Drawing Tree 
    + Base Node 
      * Scheduler (Working...)
      * Tree Operator (Working...)
